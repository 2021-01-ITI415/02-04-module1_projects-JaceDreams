 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

Due to being sick with covid, I've been playing catch up for the past week. I wanted to do something more for my Prototype, but I settled on 
recreating the classic game of Pong. If I had more time, I would've wanted to do something like Roll-a-Ball, where the ball is on planet, and 
the player has to roll around and collect objects while dodging meteors that are falling onto the planet.
